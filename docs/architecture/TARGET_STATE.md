# Target State

Third Code ERP remains an incremental TypeScript system. The target is a
modular monolith, not a rewrite and not a microservice fleet.

## Authority boundaries

```text
Browser
  -> Next.js frontend/BFF
    -> NestJS modular monolith
      -> PostgreSQL transaction + audit
      -> Redis/BullMQ
      -> object storage
      -> Python analysis services
```

- Next.js owns rendering, interaction, browser-safe reads, and compatibility
  adapters during migration.
- NestJS authorizes and commits official ERP transactions.
- PostgreSQL is the source of truth and enforces critical constraints.
- Redis and BullMQ provide queues, retries, caching, idempotency coordination,
  and distributed locks.
- Python returns analysis, extraction, forecasts, and document-processing
  evidence. It never approves or finalizes an ERP transaction.
- Supabase Storage or an equivalent object store holds files; PostgreSQL holds
  tenant-scoped metadata and immutable evidence references.

## Required invariants

1. Every business record has a non-null tenant scope.
2. Every sensitive command has explicit capability authorization.
3. Official mutations and their audit attribution share one database
   transaction.
4. Monetary values use exact decimal/numeric types, never floating point.
5. Approval workflows use explicit persisted state machines and guarded
   transitions.
6. Retryable critical commands have an idempotency key and durable result.
7. Critical integrity is protected by database constraints as well as service
   validation.
8. Browser code cannot write sensitive tables directly.
9. AI output is advisory and traceable to inputs/model/version.
10. Existing public behavior is preserved until a replacement slice passes
    contract, integration, tenant-isolation, security, and rollback checks.

## Nest module shape

Modules align to business capabilities: identity/access, tenants, CRM,
projects, cost control, procurement, inventory, construction, finance,
documents, workflow, audit, and reporting. Modules share one deployment and
one transaction boundary where required; they do not share private tables or
reach through each other's internals.

## Release evidence

- Keep root package-manager policy in the supported workspace configuration;
  frozen installs must not mutate the reviewed lockfile or emit ignored-setting
  warnings.
- Rebuild PostgreSQL 17 from zero and reject skipped database tests.
- Exercise Nest identity, membership, capability, tenant, concurrency, audit,
  and rollback behavior against that disposable database.
- Use real Redis for readiness and container smoke checks.
- Compare the target database migration ledger before any rollout.
- Never use a production database as a write-test fixture.
- Require a read-only, hash-bearing release plan for every hosted target.
- For non-linear history, reconcile an isolated restored clone with a new
  forward-only migration; never blindly replay missing historical files.
- Treat platform backup/PITR and Storage object recovery as separate evidence.
- Require database test commands to receive an explicit disposable
  `DATABASE_URL`; never auto-load an application `.env.local` as a write-test
  target.
- Use a direct or session-mode PostgreSQL connection for migration tooling.
  Reserve transaction-mode poolers for application traffic that does not
  require prepared statements.
