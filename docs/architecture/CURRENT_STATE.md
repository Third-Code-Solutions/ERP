# Current State

Verified from the repository and the configured Supabase target on 2026-07-28.
Application deployments are reported separately and are never inferred from a
successful build.

## Runtime topology

| Area | Verified implementation |
|---|---|
| Frontend | `apps/web`: Next.js 15.5.18 App Router, React 19.2.6, TypeScript 5.9.3 |
| Existing application backend | 47 Next.js Server Action files, 24 Route Handler files, SQL functions/triggers, and Supabase clients |
| New core ERP boundary | `apps/api`: NestJS 11 modular-monolith foundation. Project update is the first feature-flagged transaction slice and is off by default |
| Database | PostgreSQL 17 through Supabase; Drizzle 0.40.1; 44 SQL migrations and 45 Drizzle schema files |
| Authentication | Supabase Auth. Tenant membership and role come from PostgreSQL, not client claims |
| Authorization | RLS plus mixed application checks in the legacy path. The Nest slice has deny-by-default capability metadata and tenant-scoped queries |
| Async work | Inngest is the active legacy job system. Redis 5/BullMQ 5 are wired into the Nest foundation but have no migrated business jobs yet |
| Python | `apps/workers`: FastAPI document/DXF processing service. A legacy path can write `scope_items` directly and must be removed |
| Files | Supabase Storage |
| Deployment | Next.js is live on Vercel. NestJS is live on Railway with managed Redis and healthy database/queue readiness. Both current production releases are attributed to `kurtgav` |

## Dependency configuration

- pnpm 10.33.0 is pinned by `packageManager`.
- Root dependency overrides and peer-warning policy now live in
  `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, the configuration source pnpm 10 reads.
- `drizzle-orm` remains pinned to 0.40.1 across API, web, and database
  packages.
- Moving the ignored `package.json#pnpm` settings did not change
  `pnpm-lock.yaml`; its SHA-256 remained
  `A95947EAAF1B9D3801A27D5F551EF29239E1CF930BBD1FF8AAD0DF925E41A2C3`.

## Configured database release status

The authorized Supabase target `aqqrtkmtcsfkbyyqxowv` is PostgreSQL 17 and
matches the repository migration contract:

- Migration ledger: 44 of 44 applied; no missing or unexpected versions.
- Catalog: 86 public tables and 315 RLS policies.
- Verifier: all 30 protected-table groups, constraints, triggers, privileges,
  tenant controls, and finance/inventory authority checks pass.
- A forward-only hardening migration fixes the mutable `jsonb_diff`
  `search_path` and removes browser/service execution from maintenance-only
  helpers.
- Business baselines remained unchanged across the migration: 2 tenants,
  13 users, 25 projects, 13 purchase orders, 4 invoices, 660 audit rows,
  37 Storage objects, PHP 3,786,420.00 in purchase orders, and
  PHP 1,182,006.54 invoice net total.
- `supabase/seed.sql` was intentionally not applied because it is a local/CI
  reset fixture, not production data.

## Where business logic lives

- React/Next server modules: form parsing, permissions, writes, and audit calls.
- Next Route Handlers: integrations, uploads, webhooks, automation, and API
  surfaces.
- PostgreSQL: RLS, constraints, functions, triggers, ledger invariants, and
  audit support.
- Inngest/Edge Functions: scheduled and event-driven legacy jobs.
- Python: parsing and analysis, plus one prohibited direct-write legacy path.
- NestJS: Project update authorization and atomic transaction authority only,
  behind `ERP_PROJECT_WRITES_VIA_API=false`.

## Milestone 1 implementation

`PATCH /v1/projects/:projectId` now provides:

- Supabase bearer-token verification.
- Server-side tenant membership lookup.
- Explicit `project.update` capability enforcement.
- Strict shared Zod command validation.
- Tenant-scoped `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`.
- Optimistic concurrency through `expectedUpdatedAt`.
- One PostgreSQL transaction for actor attribution and the official write.
- Existing Next Server Action contract and cache refresh behavior.
- Safe rollback to the legacy write path with one disabled-by-default flag.

## Hosted release status

- GitHub source is published to `Third-Code-Solutions/ERP`; the reviewed
  deployment milestone is present on `main`.
- GitHub CLI and Git operations use `kurtgav`. GitHub Actions cannot start
  runners because the organization account has a billing/spending-limit
  block; the failure occurs before any workflow step executes.
- Railway project `a21fd382-80b2-4218-8025-11f420a062e3` runs the NestJS
  service `Third Code ERP API` and a managed Redis service.
- `https://third-code-erp-api-production.up.railway.app/health` returns
  `status=ok`; `/ready` returns `database=ok` and `redis=ok`.
- The current Railway deployment is
  `83849120-b063-4275-8727-0f6b13f0cd4e`, built remotely from the reviewed
  Dockerfile and `railway.toml` after commit
  `4fd1451e756ccb578ed013016d644e5048af6f92`.
- Vercel project `prj_5yZX5MTJdXZYWRIeS50jVhmjqzdb` is reconnected to
  `Third-Code-Solutions/ERP`. The `main` lineage serves
  `https://thirdcode-erp.vercel.app`; verified runtime baseline
  `dpl_9X7Vwgjj22R7WxyhJte8aTLBYiSd` is READY on reviewed commit
  `4fd1451e756ccb578ed013016d644e5048af6f92`.
- Vercel Web Analytics is enabled. Its production script returns JavaScript
  with HTTP 200 and the final desktop browser console is clean.
- A live no-write Supabase Auth proof covers missing/invalid bearer tokens,
  insufficient capability, cross-tenant lookup, malformed identifiers, and
  stale concurrency. All target Project fields and the 660-row audit baseline
  remained unchanged.
- Web-generated UUID correlation IDs now cross the Next-to-Nest boundary.
  Project command attempts return the same `x-request-id` and emit one
  structured outcome containing only operation, method, status, outcome, and
  duration. A deployed pre-guard 401 was matched to its Railway log.
- `ERP_CORE_API_URL` is configured for the Railway API. The production and
  preview Project-write migration flag remains disabled; no provider
  environment value was changed during this milestone.

## Current quality classification

| Classification | Evidence |
|---|---|
| Implemented | Broad construction ERP UI, Supabase schema/RLS, server actions, route handlers, audit infrastructure, Inngest jobs, first Nest transaction slice |
| Incomplete | Nest migration, Redis/BullMQ business jobs, uniform capability checks, uniform transactional audit, Python write removal, production-write activation evidence, clean CI, and provider-level rollback |
| Mock/demo | Repository and live application contain demo-oriented data and optional-provider fallbacks |
| Duplicated | Business rules and authorization are split across server actions, handlers, SQL, and worker code |
| Broken/risky | Python direct database write; optional Python shared secret; process-local rate limiting; elevated server credentials can bypass RLS; several audit writes are not in the same transaction as the mutation |

## Critical production risks

1. Any server path using an elevated database URL must include a verified
   `tenant_id` predicate; RLS may not protect that connection.
2. Sensitive legacy actions do not yet use one consistent capability policy.
3. Some legacy mutation and application-audit writes can commit separately.
4. Python can currently finalize a business-table write, contrary to the
   target authority boundary.
5. Python authentication can be optional and its CORS policy can be broad.
6. Rate limiting is process-local and cannot coordinate multiple instances.
7. Storage accepts a larger object than one documented application limit.
8. A clean local database reset requires Docker, which was unavailable during
   this milestone; clean-schema migration reproduction remains a CI gate.
9. Live-looking secrets exist in ignored local environment files. They were
   not copied into source or logs and should be rotated.
10. The existing worktree contains extensive pre-existing changes. Migration
    work must remain narrowly staged and reviewed.
11. The repository's current `lint` tasks are TypeScript checks, not a
    configured ESLint rule set.
12. Remaining Supabase advisor warnings include an extension in `public`,
    intentional RLS helper execution, and dashboard-level leaked-password
    protection; these require separate reviewed changes.
13. GitHub Actions is blocked before runner startup by the organization
    account's failed-payment/spending-limit state. Local green gates do not
    substitute for the skipped disposable PostgreSQL/Redis CI lane.
14. The migrated Project-write flag must remain disabled until clean CI and a
    provider-level enable/rollback drill are complete. Controlled hosted
    transaction, audit-attribution, and restoration evidence is complete.
15. Database test harnesses now require an explicitly injected
    `DATABASE_URL`; normal unit-test commands cannot auto-load a hosted
    application `.env.local`.

## Verification coverage

- Seventeen Nest unit/HTTP tests cover identity, database-derived tenancy,
  capability policy, atomic update, cross-tenant denial, stale-write conflict,
  strict request validation, legacy UUID compatibility, and malformed UUID
  rejection, request correlation, outcome classification, and log
  sanitization.
- Nest HTTP tests cover the preserved success contract and strict rejection of
  attacker-controlled fields. Four HTTP tests include real
  `ProjectsModule` middleware registration.
- Sixty-seven Web unit tests include exact feature-flag selection, legacy
  write/audit rollback behavior, Nest-only routing when enabled, and
  Next-to-Nest correlation forwarding.
- API and web TypeScript checks pass for the new slice.
- API production compilation passes.
- The built API starts independently: `/health` returns 200, an unauthenticated
  Project write returns 401, and `/ready` returns 503 when its deliberately
  absent database and Redis dependencies are unavailable.
- Fresh uncached workspace tests pass with 244 executed tests; 128 database
  cases are skipped unless a disposable database URL and capability flags are
  explicitly injected.
- A disposable-database Nest integration test now covers 401, 403, cross-tenant
  404, stale 409, successful update, trigger audit actor, and final rollback.
  It is wired into the clean PostgreSQL 17 CI job but has not run locally
  because Docker is unavailable.
- The production database catalog and migration ledger were verified.
- The deployed Railway API passed live `/health` and `/ready` checks against
  the configured PostgreSQL and Redis dependencies.
- A deployed unauthenticated Project PATCH returned 401 and echoed its safe
  UUID correlation header. Railway recorded the same ID as
  `erp.command.outcome`, operation `project.update`, outcome `rejected`, with
  no bearer token, payload, query, tenant, user, or Project identifier.
- A controlled authorized demo Project update and exact-value restoration both
  returned 200 through the deployed Nest API. Railway correlated both UUIDs
  as successful `project.update` commands.
- Supabase independently confirmed the original business values were restored,
  exactly two append-only Project audit rows were added, both rows identify
  the authorized same-tenant owner, both diffs contain only `notes` and
  `updated_at`, the marker round trip is exact, and the tenant hash chain is
  continuous.
- The temporary Supabase Auth refresh session was revoked after the proof. Its
  one-hour access JWT and all locally held credentials were cleared from the
  in-memory execution kernel.
- One-time admin-generated Supabase magic links were consumed without password
  resets to prove live identity resolution. Missing/invalid tokens returned
  401, a Viewer returned 403, a cross-tenant Project returned 404, a malformed
  identifier returned 400, and an authorized stale command returned 409.
- The live proof made no business writes: both target Project snapshots and
  the audit count/latest timestamp were unchanged at 660 rows.
- Production data exposed one valid non-v4 Project UUID. The API now accepts
  any syntactically valid UUID while retaining malformed-ID rejection; tenant
  scope remains the resource authority.
- Seven release-planner tests pass for current, linear-gap, non-linear,
  unexpected-history, SQL-risk, hash, and release-blocker behavior.
- Nest HTTP contract tests use an explicit 15-second harness timeout after a
  concurrent uncached build/test stress run exceeded Vitest's 5-second
  default. The unchanged suite passes in isolation and in a fresh uncached
  workspace test run.
- A frozen pnpm install passes without the prior ignored-configuration
  warning, keeps the lockfile byte-identical, and resolves
  `drizzle-orm@0.40.1` in all three consumers.
- Fresh uncached Nest and Next production builds pass; Next generated all
  77 pages.
- Gitleaks 8.30.1 reports zero findings for the exact staged change set.
- Vercel production build is READY on the reviewed SHA. Live checks pass for
  landing, login, protected-dashboard redirect, robots, sitemap, canonical
  metadata, desktop/mobile overflow, images, analytics, and release identity.
- Live source/DOM scans contain no former-product or prohibited external ERP
  branding.
